While learning at Henry, I became an expert Googler, I am now able to figure out most problems on my own. I also now know how to learn independently and during our final project I taught myself new technologies very easily. I am intrigued and interested in the world of programming as well as solving in the most practical, understandable and at the same time scalable way, the challenges that  rise when developing a project.",
